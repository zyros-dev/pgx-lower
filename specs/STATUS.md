# Spec status board

Single pane of glass for the performance-roadmap specs in this directory. The
DAG (`00-dag.md`) defines *what can be worked on*; this file tracks *what's
actually being worked on right now*.

Update via `just spec-claim NN BRANCH`, `just spec-release NN`, `just spec-complete NN PR`.
Don't edit the table by hand — the recipes preserve column alignment and commit
atomically against `main` so concurrent agents can't claim the same spec.

## States

- `available` — no one is working on it; blockers (per the DAG) may still apply.
- `claimed` — someone is starting; branch may not exist yet.
- `in_progress` — branch exists, work is happening.
- `in_review` — PR is open, awaiting review/merge.
- `blocked` — work paused; see Notes for why.
- `done` — landed on `main`. Don't claim.

## Conventions

- **Owner** is a free-form short identifier. Use whatever helps you tell agents
  apart at a glance (e.g. `claude-04-19-am`, `nick-pair`, `claude-fast-mode`).
- **Branch** matches the worktree name from `just worktree-new`.
- **PR** is the GitHub PR number once one is open.
- **Notes** is for blockers, partial progress, "running A/B now," etc.
- A `done` row stays on the board so the next agent can scan landed work
  without diffing git history.

## Reading the DAG together with this file

A spec being `available` here doesn't mean you can start it — its row in
`00-dag.md` may list a blocker that's still `available` or `in_progress`.
Always check the DAG first.
